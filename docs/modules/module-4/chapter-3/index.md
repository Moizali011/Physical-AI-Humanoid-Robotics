# Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning and Capstone Project

## Overview

This chapter represents the culmination of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, focusing on cognitive planning using Large Language Models and implementing the capstone autonomous humanoid robot project. Cognitive planning involves high-level reasoning about tasks, goals, and strategies, enabling robots to perform complex, multi-step operations.

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the textbook: ROS 2 communication (Module 1), simulation and digital twins (Module 2), AI integration and navigation (Module 3), and Vision-Language-Action systems (Module 4). Students will implement an autonomous humanoid robot that demonstrates embodied intelligence through integrated capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement cognitive planning systems using LLMs for robotic tasks
- Design hierarchical task planning and execution frameworks
- Integrate all previous modules' concepts into a complete robotic system
- Implement safety and validation systems for autonomous robots
- Evaluate and improve the performance of integrated robotic systems
- Document and present complex robotic systems effectively

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into three lessons that build toward the complete capstone system:

1. **Lesson 1: Cognitive Planning Concepts** - Explore the fundamentals of cognitive planning and how LLMs can guide robotic task execution.

2. **Lesson 2: Planning Algorithms for Robotics** - Implement specific planning algorithms that leverage LLM capabilities for robotic applications.

3. **Lesson 3: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot Project** - Integrate all textbook concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid robot system.
