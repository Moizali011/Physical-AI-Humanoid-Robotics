# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the foundational middleware for connecting digital AI systems with physical robots. We'll explore how ROS 2 functions as the "nervous system" of robotic systems, enabling seamless communication between sensors, processors, and actuators.

In Physical AI, the connection between digital algorithms and physical embodiment is paramount. ROS 2 provides the standardized framework that makes this connection possible, allowing AI algorithms to influence and respond to the physical world through robotic systems. This module will provide you with the essential knowledge and skills to build robotic systems that exhibit embodied intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in connecting digital AI systems with physical robots
- Implement fundamental ROS 2 communication patterns (nodes, topics, services)
- Create intelligent agents using Python and the rclpy client library
- Design robotic systems that demonstrate the principles of embodied intelligence
- Apply appropriate communication architectures based on the requirements of your robotic application

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Foundations
- Understanding ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system
- Core communication patterns: nodes, topics, and services
- Building intelligent agents with rclpy

### Chapter 2: Advanced ROS 2 Concepts
- Actions and complex task coordination
- Parameter management and system configuration
- Lifecycle nodes and system management

### Chapter 3: ROS 2 for Humanoid Robots
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid modeling
- TF (Transform) system for spatial relationships
- Integration with humanoid-specific control systems
