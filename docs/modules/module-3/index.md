# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

Module 3 explores the integration of artificial intelligence with robotic systems, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac as the platform for creating intelligent robotic brains. This module addresses the core challenge of Physical AI: connecting digital AI systems with physical robots to create embodied intelligence.

The AI-Robot brain encompasses perception, reasoning, and action capabilities that allow robots to understand their environment, make decisions, and execute complex behaviors. NVIDIA Isaac provides a comprehensive platform that includes simulation, perception algorithms, navigation systems, and AI integration tools specifically designed for robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives
